# Pavel Safronov
## Software Engineer

I'm a software engineer with more than decade of experience. I've started when there were no cloud services and mongodb was a new cutting-edge technology.

I'm passionate about infrastructure and AI and put most of my effort in these two areas. However, for the last few years I was working as a product developer to close some gaps I have in this area. Long-term I'm looking for ML infrastructure role.

Feel free to check out my [blog posts](/posts/) where I try to share my insights in areas where I developed deep technical expertise.
